That's a landing page for a small local business that was just opened. But for me it's the first production website I've ever done, to create which it took the whole month for me. But I don't regret it, during the process I was doing my best and eventually, I learned a bunch of new stuff! Yeah, and also the site drastically increased the number of customers - I think, this is the victory.

UPD: After the recent refactoring I can proudly call this landing the most complicated beyond of its type. I used a lot of technologies whiches make it overcomplicated. Also, you can look at my way of structuring code in the [Modern Boilerplate](https://github.com/DZakh/Modern-Boilerplate).
