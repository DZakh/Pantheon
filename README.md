# pantheon.fun
 ## Intro
 This's a landing page for a small local business that's just opened. But for me it's the first production website I've ever done, to create which it took the whole month for me. But I don't regret, during the process I was doing my best and eventually I learned a bunch of new stuff! Yeah, and also the site drastically increased the number of customers - I think, this is the victory.
 ## Contributors
 Everything you can see is done by me. Unfortunately in the most beginning I was lazy to make layout, so the rest of the time I was need to figure out design on the place.
 And also many thanks to my brother who has learned back-end especially for the site and has done the server-side of the form that sends data to email, vk and telegram. Here is his GitHub - [AKRONA](https://github.com/AKRONA) 
 ## What I used and what I've learned
- Working without any layout  
I don't want to try the experience again
- I got a lot of new knowledge about UX. People don't act as you predicted at all...
- Full responsive design - obviously
- Mobile-first approach  
It's a pretty cool thing and quite easy. I don't understand why there are so many people who are afraid of this.
- Css grid and especially grid areas  
I don't want to touch Bootstrap now, but I will :-(
- Creating own icon font instead of downloading the whole pack of FA icons.
I use [Icomoon](https://icomoon.io). This drastically improves the performance.
- Loading optimization for images:
  - Responsive images
  - WebP images
  - Lazy loading images
- Work with widgets  
They are loading too slow, so I had to figure out lazy loading for them too. Intersection observer helped here with this.
- First met Npm. Fell in love with Npm.
- Here are the packages I used:
  - **lazysizes** for async and lazy load of images
  - **normalize.css** just for fun
  - **siema** super cool and simple slider (much better than Glidejs that I tried before)
  - And few more for server side
- I met jQuery first time. I did my best to rewrite it to vanilla JS :-) It's a bit stupid, I know.
- I learned about Builders (Parcel in my case), but it was too late to implement it to my code.
- Basics of work with node server.
- Also I touched SEO and Website promotion.
- And did my best with *Performance* (90%), *Accessibility* (100%), *Best practices* (93%), *SEO* (100%) optimization. These are final results of google audit inside of the brackets.
## Let's wrap it up
I agree that this web page isn't perfect, but I'm very satisfied with the work I've done. Of course, later there will be some bug fixes, new features and also maybe transition to CMS, but all this in the future ;-)  
*Thank you for reading this blog-like readme!*
